    "This notebook is based on my learning from **course 3** of the **Deep Learning Specialization** provided by **deeplearning.ai**. The course videos could be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFX8k1kXhOw&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6E7jZ9sN_xHwSHOdjUxUW_b) or [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). Learning through Coursera is highly recommended to get access to the quizes and programmin exercises along the course, as well as the course certification upon completion. Personally, I completed the specialization of 5 coursesand acquired [Specialization Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/e590c28a5c258e500ca6d3ccb4ed57ba). Later, I discovered the YouTube videos and used them for review."
